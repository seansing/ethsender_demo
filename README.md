# EthSender Demo

This is a public demo using Autonomy Network's solution to automated transaction sending. 

EthSender Demo allows one to send ETH to anyone at a later time on the Ropsten testnet. On the UI, simply input the receipient's address, the amount of ETH to send, the time to send it (in Unix timestamp) and send the transaction!

To test this, run the code below once the repo is cloned.

```
cd client 
npm run start
```
Note : Ensure that your MetaMask account is connected to the Ropsten network and that it has some test Ropsten ETH.
